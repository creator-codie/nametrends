## 7‑day iteration plan for NameTrends

This backlog outlines the next week of improvements and experiments for the NameTrends site. Adjust as data and user feedback come in.

### Day 1
- Submit `sitemap.xml` to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.
- Add the site link to relevant forums and social media posts (e.g., parenting subreddits, baby name forums).

### Day 2
- Monitor GitHub Pages analytics to gather initial pageview data.
- Research keywords around baby names to identify additional content opportunities (e.g., “rare girl names,” “nature‑inspired names”).

### Day 3
- Implement an FAQ section explaining the dataset, ranking methodology and how often the site updates.
- Create a lead magnet (e.g., a PDF of the top 50 names with meanings) and set up an email capture form (use Buttondown free tier).

### Day 4
- Evaluate performance of affiliate links (if enabled) and adjust placement on pages.
- Share a second round of social posts with interesting insights (e.g., names that have fallen the most).

### Day 5
- Experiment with increasing the number of names processed per build (e.g., from 100 to 200 trending names) to see if more content drives additional traffic.
- Start researching cross‑promotional opportunities with parenting bloggers.

### Day 6
- Review KPI sheet and update with metrics collected so far.
- Decide whether to add additional datasets (e.g., state‑level names or Canadian baby names) based on demand and feasibility.

### Day 7
- Plan the next week’s experiments based on results: decide which features to keep, expand, or remove.
- If early traction is weak, brainstorm pivot options such as niche name lists (e.g., sci‑fi inspired names) or user‑generated name voting.
